\section*{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The following questions should each be answered in this Rmarkdown document with R code to accompany the R output. Be sure to provide many comments in the script to facilitate grading. Undocumented code will not be graded. Once your work is finished, submit the Rmd file as well as the knitted PDF to the appropriate problem set module on Canvas.
\item You may work in teams, but each student should develop their own R script. To be clear, there should be no copy and paste. Each keystroke in the assignment should be your own.
\item If you have any questions regarding the Problem Set, contact the TA or use office hours.
\item For students new to programming, this may take a while. Get started.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Benford's law}

Recent work in political science has proposed Benford's law as a
method for identifying electoral fraud.  The idea is that specific
integer totals should appear in the \textit{first significant digit} a
known number of times if the data is being generated ``naturally.''

\subsubsection*{1. Calculating violations}

Two ways of testing violations of Benford's law are proposed below.
Let $X_i$ represent the observed proportional frequency of the integer
$i$ in observed vote totals.  So, for example, $X_1$ would represent
the proportion vote totals where the integer $1$ appears in the first
significant digit.

\begin{itemize}
\item Leemis' $m$ statistic

$$m = max_{i=1}^9\Big\{ (X_i) - log_{10}(1+1/i)\Big\} $$
\item Cho-Gains' $d$

$$d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^9\Big( (X_i) - log_{10}(1+1/i)\Big)^2 }$$


\end{itemize}


\noindent Write a function to calculate these statistics.  The
function should take as an input (i) a matrix or vector of election
returns and (ii) an option (or options) that controls whether the $m$
statistic should be calculated, the $d$ statistic should be calculated,
or both.  The output should be a list containing the results,
\textit{including the full digit distribution}.


```{r}
test <- faraway::gavote$gore
# INPUTS: 
# - Matrix or Vector of election returns
# - Options that control if the 'm' and/or 'd' statistic should be calculated

# Output:
# - List containing results
# - and full digit distribution

# Function outline
# - Check if input is valid
# - Get proportion of 
# - if M is true
#   - input m statistic into list
#   - sapply this?
# - If D is true
#   - put d into list
#   - sapply this?
# - Insert Full digit distribution into list
# - Return List


benfordsLaw <- function(x, m = TRUE, d = TRUE) {

  # TESTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  if ((is.matrix(x) | is.vector(x)) == FALSE) {
    stop("Input 'x' is not a matrix or vector")
  }

  if (!(m == TRUE | m == FALSE)) {
    stop("m must be a Logical")
  }

  if (!(d == TRUE | d == FALSE)) {
    stop("d must be a Logical")
  }

  # INSIDE FUNCTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------
  propFreq <- function(y) {
    return(y - log10(1 + (1 / y)))
  }

  actualProp <- function(z) {
    # make new vector with only the first integer
    # This currently does not work well with negative numbers. I'll update to
    # add the removing of symbols. That should get rid of the warnings about NAs
    firstInteger <- as.numeric(substr(abs(as.numeric(z)), 1, 1))

    # remove any instances where the value is equal to 0
    firstInteger <- firstInteger[firstInteger != 0]

    # if for some strange reason one integer does not show up setting it as a
    # factor with levels should fix this
    table <- prop.table(table(factor(firstInteger, 1:9)))
    return(table)
  }

  # PRODUCE STATISTICS ---------------------------------------------------------
  freq <- actualProp(x)
  list <- list(freq)
  class(list) <- "benfords"
  i <- 2
  if (m == TRUE) {
    # use a sapply function to run through 1 - 9? Something like what I did in
    # the previous assignment
    # I can call the table using obj
    m <- max(propFreq(freq[1:9]))^9
    list[[i]] <- m
    i <- i + 1
  }

  if (d == TRUE) {
    d <- sqrt(sum(propFreq(freq[1:9])^2))
    list[[i]] <- d
    i <- i + 1
  }
  return(list)
}

trial <- benfordsLaw(test, TRUE, TRUE)
trial
```


\subsubsection*{2. Critical values}


For each statistic, we can reject the null hypothesis of \textit{no
  fraud} if the statistic reaches the critical values in the table below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l}
& $\alpha=0.10$ & $\alpha=0.05$ & $\alpha=0.01$ \\
Leemis' $m$ & 0.341 & 0.691 & 0.875 \\
Cho-Gains' $d$ & 0.391 & 0.651 & 0.933 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\noindent 
Create a new function called \texttt{print.benfords()} that will output a table containing:

\begin{itemize}
\item The name of each statistic
\item The statistic as it was calculated
\item The relevant number of asterisk's (e.g., one star for
  significance at the $\alpha=.10$ level, etc.)
\item A legend at the bottom explaining the asterisk's (similar to
  what you see when you print an \texttt{lm} object.).
\end{itemize}

\noindent You can provide this output in any way you like, but it must be
clearly organized and easy to understand.  Don't forget to document your code.

```{r}
print.benfords <- function(x) {
  sig <- c()
  
  if (x[[2]] >= 0.875) {
    sig[1] <- "***"
  } else if (x[[2]] < 0.875 & x[[2]] >= 0.691) {
    sig[1] <- "**"
  } else if (x[[2]] < 0.691 & x[[2]] >= 0.341) {
    sig[1] <- "*"
  } else {
    sig[1] <- " "
  }
  
  if (x[[3]] >= 0.933) {
    sig[2] <- "***"
  } else if (x[[3]] < 0.933 & x[[3]] >= 0.651) {
    sig[2] <- "**"
  } else if (x[[3]] < 0.651 & x[[3]] >= 0.391) {
    sig[2] <- "*"
  } else {
    sig[2] <- " "
  }
  
  stats <- matrix(c(x[[2]], x[[3]], sig), nrow = 2)
  colnames(stats) <- c("Actual Value", "Significance")
  rownames(stats) <- c("Leemis", "Cho-Gains")
  #stats <- as.data.frame(stats)
  
  sig_message <- "Signif. codes:  0.01 ‘***’ 0.05 ‘**’ 0.1 ‘*’"
  
  print(as.table(stats))
  cat(sig_message)
}
trial

```
